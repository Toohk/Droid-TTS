# Droid TTS

Transform text into droid-like "beeps".

## Description

This Python script converts any given text into a sequence of droid-like "beeps". Each word from the input text is represented by a unique "beep" based on its specific characteristics (e.g., its first and last letter, word length, etc.).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy

You can install the dependencies using:

\```bash
pip install numpy scipy
\```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Modify the `text` variable in the script to your desired text.
3. Run the script with Python:

\```bash
python droid_tts.py
\```

This will generate a `text_as_droid_sound.wav` file containing the droid sound based on your input text.

## Features

- Converts any text into droid-like sounds.
- Generates a unique "beep" for each word based on its characteristics.
- Adds pauses between words and longer pauses between sentences.
